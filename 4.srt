1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,900
15 minutes,15 hours...

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,000
inside the o.r.,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,690
the best surgeons  make time fly.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,780
outside the o.r.,however,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,510
time takes pleasure  in kicking our asses.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,810
for even the strongest of us,it seems to play tricks--

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,470
slowing down,hovering...

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,910
until it freezes...

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,410
leaving us stuck in a moment,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,090
unable to move  in one direction or the other.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,510
izzie.izzie. come on.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,820
okay,she's been in there all night. we have to do something.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,420
- yeah.
- yeah.yeah.

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,420
why are you all looking at me?

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,050
well,this is familiar territory for you.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,980
there is nothing familiar about this.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,420
unfamiliar.

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,580
denny died.

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,810
the man she loves died.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,020
yeah,but you're all dark and twisty inside.

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,360
"dark and twisty"?

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,760
the mother with the alzheimer's thing

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,890
and the father you don't talk to.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,290
and the teruila thing and the inappropriate men thing.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,190
you are dark and twisty inside,meredith,and now izzie is dark and twisty inside.

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,860
so all of a sudden i'm the president of people with crappy lives?

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,860
seriously,we have to do something.

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,500
someone has to go in there.

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,910
the seven years  you spend as a surgical resident

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,750
will be the best  and worst of your life.

31
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,160
look around you.

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,320
say hello  to your competition.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,610
hi. izzie stevens.washington.

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,820
hey. alex karev.ia.

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,400
this is nice,right? they threw a mixer for the new interns.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,880
yeah.

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,360
it's just an excuse to get us all happy and drunk before they torture us.

38
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,810
- what program are you in?
- surgery.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,660
- seriously?
- seriously.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,290
what?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,270
i-i picked you for gynie or peds or something.

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,680
you don't think i can be a surgeon?

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,140
i can be a surgeon.

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,040
surgery's hard-core.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,920
i'm hard-core.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,090
you won't last the first year,babe.

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,710
hey,izzie. what?

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,040
maybe you should...

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,640
ch-change your clothes.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,890
maybe you'd want to wear something more comfortable.

51
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,290
- stop it.
- i know.

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,800
- izzie--
- stop it.i mean it.stop...talking.

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,730
there is nothing to talk about. do you understand me?

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,130
there is nothing to discuss.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,960
i'm so sorry.

56
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,640
yeah.yeah,me,too.

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,410
- so you're a surgeon.
- yes.

58
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,440
usually they don't send a surgeon for this.

59
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,050
what--what do we need to-- how do i do this?

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,220
how do we do this?

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,860
you just gotta i.d.the body before i take him to the funeral home...

62
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,210
so i don't take the wrong guy.

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,020
that happens?

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,920
you wouldn't believe how many times i take the wrong guy.

65
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,680
th-that's him.that's... denny duruette.

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,400
great. load him up.and sign.

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,790
when's the funeral?

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,740
no funeral.

69
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,980
the family asked to have the body sent to memphis.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,910
uh,wait,wait,wait,wait.

71
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,800
i'm sorry.

72
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,290
i'm so sorry.

73
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,580
why are we making sandwiches again?

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,740
it's what you do when someone dies. you cook.

75
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,850
yeah,i-i know what to do when someone dies.

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,220
i am a jew.

77
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,620
i know food and death.

78
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,140
it's shivah.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,700
is it shivah even if she's catholic?

80
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,200
well,shivah's what i know how to do,so...

81
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,980
yeah,it's shivah.

82
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,290
and if we're sitting shivah for denny,

83
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,510
then we should order in

84
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,840
because making sandwiches is not the same as cooking.

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,580
sandwiches are comfort food.

86
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,540
what's wrong with you?

87
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,410
everything with me is fine.

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,710
it's izzie thate're worried about.

89
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,530
oh,what did you do?

90
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,800
denny died. burke got shot.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,170
let's just have some perspective and remember what i did is a tiny,slightly small--

92
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,690
whatever. spit it out.

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,620
i lost my panties last night.

i did a craniotomy on a,uh,ruptured saccular aneurysm.

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
i've been here all night,too.

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,960
i wanted to see the autopsy on duruette.

102
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,240
yeah.

103
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,420

104
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,680

no,could you just--

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,920
can you get somebody to cover my rounds for me so i can take care of some stuff?

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,620
are you free,dr.shepherd?

110
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,090
and the pit's overcrowded with early flu season.

111
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,740
giselle toussaint,42-year-old woman,

112
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,630
unrestrained driver of a car that hit a railing.

113
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,960
ejected from the car.

114
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,740
she was--we were coming to the e.r.

115
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,860
we were both sick.

116
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,420
we couldn't shake this flu thing.

117
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,160
so she was better,so i let her drive.

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,200
- sir?
- omar?

119
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,800
giselle,honey.

120
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,520

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,000
- are we dancing?
- we had an accident.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,860
we have a dural laceration. she's leaking spinal fluid.

124
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,940
let's get an o.r.ready,okay?

125
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,560

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,440

premature newborn found in a trash can at turner prep school.

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,680
the umbilical cord's still attached.

132
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,820
you didn't start an i.v.? he's dehydrated.

133
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,030
we couldn't find a vein.

134
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,490

alex,how old's that baby?

140
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,540
wait,wait,wait. what are you doing?

141
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
if you think i'm going to leave this sick,premature infant in the e.r.--

142
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,850
he has to be admitted.

143
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,380
- you can't just take him. 
- just page addison shepherd!

144
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,800
page addison shepherd. tell her to meet me in the nicu.

149
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,180
did you transfuse platelets?

150
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,370

151
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,020
- where's the mother?
- i don't know.

152
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,140
dr.karev...

153
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,570
i'm not asking you where the mother is for my health.

154
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,990
i expect you to use your brain.

155
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,470
- where is the mother?
- i don't know!

156
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,400
the baby was found in a trash can at a high school.

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,370
they left him in a trash can.

158
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,330
he's got some inner abdominal bleeding on c.t.

159
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,820
you want to run some more tests?

160
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,710
dr.shepherd?

161

if there is no cranial bleeding.

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,890
and then find out where the mother is.

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,080
i need to test for maternal platelet antibodies.

165
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,190
can't you just do surgery to fix the abdominal bleeding?

166
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,670
if i wanted to kill him,i could do that. damn it.

167
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,210
who does this?

168
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,210
dr.montgomery-shepherd,there are some people here about the baby.

169
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,960
the clot's been evacuated. are we ready to close?

170
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,910
i just want to make sure there are no remaining bone fragments.

171
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,800
how's izzie?

172
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,460
as well as can be expected.

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,780
it's never gets easier,you know? losing a patient.

174
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,230
it gets a little less...

175
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,250
shocking,i guess,but...

176
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,110
it never gets any easier.

177
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,420
izzie was in love with him.

178
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,580
denny wasn't just a patient. they were in love.

179
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,310
you had sex with derek in an exam room at the prom?

180
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,290
- yes.
- last night,you and shepherd did it?

181
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,610
yes.

182
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,530
you and mcdreamy did the nasty-nasty?

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,970
- cristina!
- i'm not judging.

184
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,950
i'm just trying to wrap my mind around it.

185
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,130
i mean,you're with finn,and he's with addison.

186
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,130
he's married to addison.

187
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,450
yeah.

188
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,660
well,what did derek say?

189
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,530
he said,"meredith,what does this mean?"

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,020
okay... he has sex with you

191
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,440
and he's standing there all mcguilty,

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
and all he has to say for himself is,

193
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,740
"oh,what does this mean?"

194
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,120
what does this mean?

195
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,520
i don't know.

196
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,890
well,are you gonna go back to finn?

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,940
uh,i-is shepherd leaving his wife?

198
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,670
- i just--
- meredith,hold on with both hands.

199
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,190
- meredith!
- mommy!

200
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,620
- richard,you were to tell adele.
- look,i-i can't.

201
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,650
- i was to tell thatcher.

202
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,430
- that is what we said.
- i can't do it.

203
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,930
that is what we agreed.

204
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,750
please,richard,please.

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
you can't leave me.

206
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,100
ellis,no.

207
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,810
richard,you can't leave me!

208
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:46,120
richard!richard!richard!

209
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,620
you didn't have to make an appointment to see me.

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,450
i'm your husband.

211
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,600
an appointment seemed to be the best way to get your undivided attention,because here you are.

212
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,880
- adele,listen--
- sit down.

213
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,500
- adele--
- sit down!

214
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,210
we have an appointment.

215
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,360
uh,chief,ex-- um,the i.d.c.is here.

216
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
we had a couple come in this morning--

217
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,960
derek just finished a craniotomy on the wife--but the husband,

218
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,860
he's got severe flu sytoms-- swollen lymph nods,buboes.

219
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,140
- turns out they came in contact with the plague.
- the plague?

220
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,600
look,i'm sorry,adele.

221
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,030
i-i need to deal with this.

222
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,520
shannon is a straight-a student.

223
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,640
so what,my daughter gets a b in math,

224
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,540
and suddenly she's birthing babies in toilet stalls?

225
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,060
i'm dr.montgomery-shepherd. i'm treating the newborn.

226
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,930
he has an emergent blood condition.

227
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,440
i need to know whose baby it is i'm dealing with.

228
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,520
yeah,we'd all like to know that.

229
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,910
sara... talk.

230
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,920
i don't know anything about any baby,mom.

231
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,940
none of us do.

232
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,480
well,one of you must know something,otherwise you and your parents wouldn't be here.

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,880
our girls--the principal said that they were the last people in the bathroom before that baby was found.

234
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,860
so we just thought,before the police show up...

235
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,790
one of you knows,and you better confess.

236
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,430
i don't want my lisa messed up in this.

237
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,600
look,the police will be here soon.

238
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,140
can't you just do some sort of d.n.a.test so that the rest of us can get out of here?

239
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,730
d.n.a.results take days,

240
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,100
and frankly,i'm not concerned with getting the rest of you "out of here."

241
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,370
if this baby isn't treated,he's going to die.

242
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,590
now i can do vaginal exams on each of the girls--

243
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,120
my daughter is 14 years old.

244
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,310
she's not sexually active.

245
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,050
and i won't have you violating her body.

246
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,200
you won't have it 'cause you know it's your kid.

247
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,470
i tell you what,you have my consent

248
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,780
to do whatever it takes to prove my lisa's innocent.

249
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,770
you are a sick bastard,you know that?

250
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,160
a child's life is in jeopardy here.

251
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,860
and it's not your consent that i need.

252
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,630
we didn't do anything wrong.

253
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,750
just because we were in there doesn't mean it's our baby.

254
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,860
do we look like the kind of girls who get pregnant and throw their kids into the trash?

255
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,550
nice work today,o'malley.

256
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,180
hey,did meredith go home with izzie?

257
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,490
yeah,cristina,too. i'm headed there now.

258
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,290
- yeah,me,too.
- oh,great.

259
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,250
it's just that,um...

260
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,610
i don't know if izzie's up for a lot of people.

261
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,430
well,i'm gonna go see meredith.

262
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,740
oh.okay.

263
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,480
- dr.shepherd?
- yes.

264
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,680
- dr.o'malley?
- yeah.

265
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,780
i'm with the i.d.c. is anyone else in this room?

266
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,600
no.

267
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,500
- you peormed the surgery on mrs.toussaint?
- yes.

268
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,730
she and her husband were in closeontact with a victim of the plague.

269
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,070
she may have been exposed.

270
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,010
- which means we may have been.
- yeah.

271
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,380
i gotta go. i can't do this.

272
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,890
we're waiting on the diagnosis on mrs.toussaint.

273
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,580
this room will be sealed off until we know the threat has been contained,and you're absolutely safe.

274
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,900
- you're not saying--
- you cannot leave.

275
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,520
you two are quarntined.

276
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,080
i should check in with the i.d.c.rep. you know,i have to stay on top of my hospital.

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,270
keep me posted.

278
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,730
hello!hello! i need help.somebody,please.

279
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,390
i know you can hear me.

280
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,920
i see you standing out there in your giant white space suit.

281
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,890
- sir?
- yes!

282
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,300

285
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,260
but he is also a patient.

286
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,120
and i will not ignore a patient.

287
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,290
ah. hello out there.

288
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,070
thank god. thank god you can hear me.

289
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,140

290
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,540
my name is dr.bailey-- miranda bailey.

291
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,820
your wife is out of surgery.

292
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,010
she's quarntined in recovery,

293
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,180
but she's doing fine.

294
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,780
now you were asking for help?

295
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,390
you know how many days i been in here?

296
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,780
it's only been a few hours.

297
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,530
really?

298
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,140
i'm losing it.

299
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,570
i'm losing track of time.

300
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,210
okay,sir,you're sweating.

301
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,080
i need you to sit down.

302
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,870

319
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,340
uh,he's in a quarntine 'cause of a-a thing.

320
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,690
and i was off duty and i was worried about him

321
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,500
and going crazy,and i thought about izzie,and so i brought food.

322
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,880
for the shivah.

323
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,190
are--are you gonna let me in?

324
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,760
yeah.

325
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,250
relax,i'm not gonna bring it up--

326
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,490
you and mcdreamy and the sex.

327
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,050
- i'm not that person.
- good.

328
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,360
- okay.
- good.

329
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,600
shivah? is it shivah if izzie's catholic?

330
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,080
this thing that you're doing,izzie,it's not healthy.

331
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,540
i mean,you gotta take off that dress.

332
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,420
tell me about shivah.

333
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,880
well,it's something you do when someone dies.

334
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,140
you know,we did it for my grandmother.

335
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,920
how does it work?

336
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,320
people bring over food,

337
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,230
family comes over.

338
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,060
it's supposed to help with the grieving,you know?

339
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,490
it honors the dead.

340
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,860
- sounds nice.
- yeah.

341
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,530
seven days of no leather shoes,

342
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,230
no--no work,no sex,

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,210
no sitting on things higher than a foot,

344
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,000
no--no shaving,no...

345
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,940
what?

346
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,990
no clean clothes.

347
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,840
izzie...

348
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,650
this doesn't have to be shivah.

349
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,960
you know they took his body away.

350
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,610
i will never see him again.

351
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,860
how would you feel if you never saw burke again?

352
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,930
so we're sitting shivah for denny.

353
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,620
you want to see him?

354
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
- see who?
- the baby.your baby.

355
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,540
it's not our baby.

356
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,760
i'm giving you permission to do this thing. now what's the hang-up?

357
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,290
the "hang-up," sir,

358
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,470
is that if your daughter doesn't want to do it,

359
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,010
i can't force her.

360
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,130
they're 14. they're minors.

361
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,390
we still have a say.

362
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,510
no,you don't.

363
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,650
if someone doesn't want to submit to a vaginal exam,

364
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,230
they don't have to. it's the law.

365
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,480
all right. that's it.

366
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,410
i'm taking lisa home.

367
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,220
you do that,sir,and i will have you arrested before you hit the parking lot.

368
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,420
the law isn't the only thing in play here.

369
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,800
if i do a vaginal exam and the girl is a virgin,

370
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,150
there could be bleeding,undue trauma,

371
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,530
not to mention emotional stress.

372
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,130
well,if i had to take a guess as to whose kid won't have to worry about that--

373
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,560
what's that supposed to mean?

374
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,570
it'd just be nice if karen had a curfew.

375
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,350
well,at least she's not a shoplifter.

376
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,840
oh,shannon stole one lipstick when she was 9. get over it.

377
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,240
i know for a fact that my lisa is a virgin.

378
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,110
really?

379
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,880
and how do you know that?

380
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,660
because she's only 14 years old!

381
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,810
they're all 14.

382
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,830
derek. derek listen to me.

383
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,970
derek,you can't do this.

384
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,680
derek,we have to--

385
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,020
- we have to talk about this.
- no,we don't.

386
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
you have to give me a chance to explain.

387
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,480
what are you doing?

388
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,720
what are you doing with my clothes,derek?!

389
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,570
was one time! i know that's what people say.

390
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,000
i know that's what always gets said,but it's--

391
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,540
i don't even know how it happened.

392
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,520
i don't know what i was thinking.

393
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,680
he was just--he was just here.

394
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:13,750
he was just here.

395
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,590
you screw my best friend,and all you can say--

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,980
"he was just here"?

397
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,770
- get out.
- no.

398
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,240

399
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,360

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,980
if you go now.

431
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,900
if you go...

432
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,510

433

434
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,660
the preston burke.

435
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,650
dr.burke,i am such a huge fan.

436
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,730
that stentless valve replacement for infectious endocarditis that you performed?

437
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,590
and your use of transmyocardial revascularization?

438
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,850
i-i'm cristina yang.

439
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,280
if--if i could just get the chance to study under you,i would be...

440
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,690
- you are so amazing! 
- yes,well...thank you.

441
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,470
i mean,one of my choices was,uh,san diego.

442
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,520
i coulda gone to san diego.

443
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,960
you know,seattle's home,so...

444
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,550
so you're new to seattle.

445
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,580
oh,no. i-i,um,i kind of live here.

446
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,230
my mother lived here-- lives here--

447
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,040
and i live in her house.

448
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,170
wow,that's great 'cause housing is a nightmare.

449
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,670
i'm living with my,uh,parents at home,

450
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,580
which,uh,well,sucks.

451
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,750
oh,it's nice meeting you.

452
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,950
we've been exposed to the plague.

453
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,250
they don't know it's the plague.

454
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,930
so the men in,uh,white suits,just,what,making a fashion statement?

455
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,100
no,it's a precaution.

456
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,130
when the blood work comes back,we'll be outta here.

457
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,710
what if the results come backand she's,uh,she has the plague?

458
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,610
well,then we get the plagueand then we die in here with the crappy benches

459
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,330
and the dirty scrubsand the lockers full of old food.

460
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,880
there's food in the lockers?

461
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,230
dr.shepherd,those are people's person--that's alex's apple.

462
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,430
that's just rude.

463
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,790
safe haven laws--all those girls would've had to do is

464
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,910
drop that baby off at a fire stationor a hospital.

465
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,460
now...

466
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,690
it's a mess.

467
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,600
what are our options here?

468
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
blood typing.

469
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,230
we take a sample from each of the girls.

470
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,200
the baby's blood type is double-o.

471
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,680
if the girls are a or b,it means the baby is not theirs.

472
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,750
do it.

473
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,580
everyone thinks i'll know what tsay to her.

474
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,040
i don't know what to say to her.

475
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
dark and twisty meredith.

476
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,360
i'm not dark and twisty.

477
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,380
and if i am dark and twisty,it's because i live my life under a banner of avoidance.

478
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,970
i avoid. i'm an avoider.

479
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,470
hello?

480
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,900
- hey. 
- hey.

481
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,800
so can we,uh--izzie.

482
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,000
i gotta go check on izzie.

483
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,610
don't take it personally.

484
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,280
it's the doctor thing.

485
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,860
what?

486
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,090
four years of high school,four years of college,four years of med school--

487
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,070
by the time we graduate,we're in our late 20s,

488
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,740
and we've never done anything except go to schooland think about science.

489
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,580
time stops.

490
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,860
we're socially retarded.

491
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,600
i mean,look at me.

492
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,540
i'm in love with a guy who won't say he loves me back,

493
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,940
and here i am in his kitchen cooking,just hoping he comes home and notices me.

494
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,010
i'm a total freak.

495
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,630
i'm that girl in the back of the classwho eats her hair.

496
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,200
meredith...

497
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,360
she's 17 years old.

498
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,960
we're all 17 years old.

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
this is high school with scalpels,finn.

500
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,260
i don't know what to say to you.

501
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,350
when dylan died...

502
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,100
when--when the bomb went off,did you feel like...

503
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,640
what?

504
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,960
like you were moving in slow motion.

505
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,880
he was there and then he wasn't,like i blinked,and he was gone.

506
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,450
i feel like i'm moving in slow motion...

507
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,170
like i'm moving in slow motionand everything around me is...

508
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,700
moving so fast. and i just want to go back...

509
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,720
to when things were normal,when i wasn't "poor izzie

510
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,740
laying on the bathroom floorin her prom dress with her..."

511
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,450
"her dead fiance"

512
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,540
but i am.

513
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,260
so i can't.

514
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,960
and i'm...

515
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,450
just stuck.

516
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,200
and there's all this pressure'cause everyone's hovering around me,

517
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,370
waiting for me to do somethingor say something or

518
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,950
flip out or yellor cry some more,and i'm happy to play my part.

519
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,870
i'm happy to say the lines and do whatever it is

520
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,710
that i'm supposed to be doingif it will make everyone feel more comfortable.

521
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,410
but i don't--i don't know how to do this.

522
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,390
i don't know how to be this person. i don't...

523
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,360
i don't know who this person is.

524
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,030
izzie...

525
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,550
how did this happen?

526
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,070
how did we end up here?

527
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,610
why am i alone?

528
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,450
where is denny?

529
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,070
you're not alone,iz.

530
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,940
trail mix and warm soda--who puts warm soda in their locker?

531
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,380
as usual,cristina's too lazyto stock her locker with food.

532
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,120
oh,now i hit the mother lode.

533
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,650
here,look at this. i got granola,cookies,muffins.

534
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,050
who eats this much?

535
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,070
that's izzie's locker.

536
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,860
she ate a lot. said it kept her energy up.

537
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,920
- eats. 
- what?

538
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,580
eats. you said,"ate." "eats," present tense. she didn't die.

539
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,850
feels a little like she did.

540
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,850
she's never comin' back here.

541
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,050
you know...

542
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,250
i don't think she's ever gonna be the same.

543
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,250
you know,there are moments,o'malley,

544
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,550
where all of a sudden,in a split second,your life changes forever.

545
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,360
before you know it,you're somewhere else.

546
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,980
- gentlemen. 
- chief.

547
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,880

548
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,720
no.

549
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,610
a split second...

550
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,140

551
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,850

557
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,730
so... is this a good place to hang out?

558
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,650
i wouldn'tnow. never been here before.

559
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,210
oh,you know what? i haven't either.

560
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,060
first time here. i'm new in town.

561
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,950
i've never been to seattle.

562
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,730
but i got a job,so...

563
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,870
ah,you're ignoring me.

564
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,460
i'm trying to.

565
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,750
you shouldn't ignore me.

566
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,990
why not?

567
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,590
because i'm someone you need to get to know to love.

568
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,900
- really? 
- oh,yes.

569
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,790
- so if i know you,i'll love you? 
- oh,yes.

570
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,680
you really like yourself,huh?

571
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,400
just hiding my pain.

572
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,980
so what's your story?

573
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,490
i don't have a story.

574
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,690
i'm just a girl in a bar.

575
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,700
i'm just a guy in a bar.

576
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,120
how do you not know your kid's pregnant?

577
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,370
you love your kids. you want to see the best in them.

578
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,810
okay,then how do you have a babyand then throw it in a trash can?

579
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,390
something happens,and yopanic.

580
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,840
you freeze,and you want to hide itand...

581
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,830
pretend like it didn't happen.

582
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,390
i get that.

583
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,310
- you get that? 
- i do.

584
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,450
i just don't get what happens afterward.

585
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,440
i don't get how...

586
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,670
you go back to classand pretend like everything's fine.

587
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,720
everything's not fine.

588
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,300
oh,it's the blood results.

589
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,200
karen and lisa are not a match.

590
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,060
and then there were two.

591
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,390
miranda...

592
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,710
i-i'm feeling better,a lot better.

593
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,900
i think the fever broke,which is good,right?

594
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,430
- that's very good,omar. 
- how'giselle?

595
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,570
is she asking for me?

596
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:11,310
omar,for giselle,being exposed to the plague,it--it complicated... things.

597
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,950
complicated what things?

598
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,400
we did everything we c-could.

599
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,780

look,even if i could let you outta here,you can't help giselle now,omar.

645
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,970
do you believe in god,miranda?

646
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,450
huh? do you...

647
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,860
do you believe in the afterlife?

648
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,410
i have to believe.

649
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:52,520
with what i do,omar,i have to believethat when our time comesthat we go to...

650
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,590
a place,a...

651
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,310
a beautiful place,a...

652
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,540
a better place.

653
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,810
omar...

654
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,060
that woman died.

655
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,220
she actually died.

656
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,960
that doesn't mean we will.

657
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,320
- is it hot in here? 
- no.

658
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,470
then why am i sweating?

659
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,770
because you're pacing.

660
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,970
no,my pulse is rapid.

661
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,000
because you're still pacing.

662
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,400
here,feel me.

663
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,290
no,i'm not gonna feel you.

664
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,520
- seriously. 
- seriously,no.

665
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,440
you know... you're an ass.

666
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,500
you've lived.

667
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,550
you've done things.

668
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,390
and you got the hair and the hot wifeand the beautiful ex-mistress who pines for you.

669
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,300
she's pining for me?

670
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,410
my point is you've lived.

671
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,790
if you die,who cares?

672
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,060
if i die...

673
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,850
what,this is it?

674
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,770
callie told me she loved me. i just sat there.

675
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,950
i mean,i wasn't ready...

676
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,270
but what,now i'm gonna die,and i'm not even gonna get a

677
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,610
chanceto say "i love you" back?

678
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,780
well,do you?

679
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,320
do you love her?

680
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,970
maybe.

681
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,740
eventually...

682
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,830
i could.

683
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,420
yeah,one day,soonish.

684
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,110
"soonish"?

685
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,020
i will love you "soonish"?

686
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,170
you ever tell meredith?

687
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,190
you ever tell her that you love her?

688
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,260
no.

689
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,500
i did.

690
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,090
but...

691
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,250
i...

692
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,060
i'm with callie...

693
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,080
and...

694
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,430
it's different,but...

695
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,500
you should tell her.

696
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,340
even if it's soonish,you should tell her before it's too late.

697
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,880
you mean before i die of the plague?

698
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,730
before somebody else comes along.

699
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,560
that i believe.

700
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,180
oh,uh...

701
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,350
i'm gonna...

702
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,890
i'm gonna leave the room for a period of timefor no reason whatsoever.

703
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,050
i don't know what happened last night...

704
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,470
between you and derek.

705
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,860
finn--and i don't want to know.

706
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,230
all right,we never said that we were exclusive.

707
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,590
but you have plans.

708
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,680
yeah.

709
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,260
well,i didn't say i wasn't pissed off.

710
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,680
i said we weren't exclusive.

711
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,740
that's all i wanted to say.

712
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,310
oh,and,uh,and this--i-i know you think you're scary and damaged.

713
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,310
dark and twisty.

714
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,040
it makes you feel like you don't deserve good things.

715
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,950
but you do.

716
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,830
and derek...

717
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,650
he's bad for you.

718
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,190
but me-- i'm a good thing.

719
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:06,080
and if there's a race,if there is a-a ring,my hat is in.

720
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,270
i made an appointment for a reason.

721
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,120
i scheduled the timebecause i had something important to say,

722
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,630
and you made me wait.

723
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,060
i have a situation,adele.

724
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,430
- you don't
- i've spent my life waiting,

725
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,990
waiting for you to finish med school,

726
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,780
waiting for you to come home at night,waiting for you to leave that...

727
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,590
woman.

728
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,260
- i'm done waiting. 
- adele--

729
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,880
it's time for you to make a choice--me or this hospital.

730
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,180
it's time for you to retire,richard.

731
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
there he is.

732
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,220
that's your son.

733
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,720
i want you both to look at him...

734
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,850
because it's not true that you did nothing wrong.

735
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,350
you both are wrong.

736
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,160
you're wrong for covering this up.

737
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,630
you're wrong for lying about it.

738
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,870
you're wrong for letting this little baby,this

739
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,590
sweet,innocent,beautiful little boysuffer like this.

740
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,040
he's dying,and it's your fault.

741
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,700
it's both of your fault.

742
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,760
and the thing is,the truth will come out.

743
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,180
in time,it will come out.

744
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,140
it always does.

745
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,710
it just...

746
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,950
it just does.

747
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,830
and when it does,this baby will be dead.

748
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,640
shannon...

749
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,050
don't tell my mom,okay?

750
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,240
thank you.

751
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,430
thank you for telling the truth.

752
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,030
you--you really don't feel anything?

753
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,310
i only feel like i've been here for a very long time.

754
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,620
i feel like i might be too late.

755
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,980
too late for what?

756
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,540
thank you for your patience and cooperation,doctors.

757
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,800
you'll have to go on a course of antibiotics,but the threat has been contained.

758
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,520
good.

759
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,430
what?

760
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,780
you're free to go.

761
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,500
poor little guy.

762
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,910
the mite he's okay,we have to turn him overto a mother who's goin' to juvieand

763
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,250
grandparents who are so clueless,they didn't even realize their own kid was pregnant.

764
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,490
imagine the kind of childhood he's gonna have.

765
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,120
you can get over a bad childhood.

766
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,550
you can have the worst crap in the world happen to you,

767
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,040
and then you can get over it.

768
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,450
all you gotta do is survive.

769
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,860
hello?

770
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,630
oh,my god.

771
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,660
oh,my god. i was so worried.

772
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,050
but i'm--i'm fine.

773
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,250
i was really,really worried.

774
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,360
yeah,i know. me,too.

775
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,680
george,i really,really love you.

776
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,970
- hi. 
- hi.

777
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,650
uh,i was gonna come over this morning,but,uh--

778
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,320
- i heard--the quarntine. 
- yeah.

779
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,670
so... what does this mean?

780
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,260
it means you have a choice.

781
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,970
you have a choice to make.

782
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,280
and i don't want to rush youinto making a decision before you're ready.

783
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:28,580
this morning,i was gonna come overand i was gonna say--

784
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,230
what i wanted to say was...

785
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,960
but now all i can say is that...

786
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,240
i'm in love with you.

787
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,610
i've been in love with you for...

788
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,130
ever.

789
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,020
i'm a little late.

790
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,640
i know i'm a little late in telling you that.

791
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,080
i-i just...

792
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,710
i just want you to take your time...

793
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,230
you know?

794
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,720
take all the time you need.

795
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,230
because you have...

796
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,430
a choice to make.

797
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,890
and when i had a choice to make...

798
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,600
i chose wrong.

799
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,500
all right. good night.

800
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,440
time flies.

801
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,050
you're not going to retire,are you?

802
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,210
adele,you spring this on me today.

803
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,250
i-i need more time.

804
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,120
i don't have any more time to give.

805
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,470
time waits for no man.

806
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,630
time heals all wounds.

807
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,920
where have you been all day?

808
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,590
sitting shivah for denny.

809
